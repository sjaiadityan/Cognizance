This program gives outputs ‘TRUE’ if a given number is divisible by 3 and ‘FALSE’ otherwise, without using the ‘%’  operator explicitly.
BEGIN

	DECLARE integers N,div,quo,rem
	get input from the user for N
	initializeq to zero
	initialize rem to N 
	initialize div to three
	WHILE rem greater than equal to div ,DO
		subtract div from rem
		increment quo to one
	end WHILE
	IF rem is equal to zero 
		PRINT “TRUE”
