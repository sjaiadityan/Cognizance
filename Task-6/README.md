    Watching is a common practice among people. It is considered as a good way of relaxing that makes people relieved. Anime has colorful graphics that attract the eyes of the viewers. They have varying contents and storylines that make the viewers exposed. These include adventure, comedy, and others. Cartoons are illustrated visual arts that are designed to create humor or satire. These are short films and programs that are designed mostly for children. To make people more relaxing and enjoying by watching anime they need a proper platform.
